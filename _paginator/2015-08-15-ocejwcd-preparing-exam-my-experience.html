<i style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">OCEJWCD (SCWCD) - 1Z0-899 - Web Component Developer Certification</i><br /><i style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><br /></i><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">In this post I will try to summarize how I have completed this certification.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I had been preparing the certification since February. I sat the exam at the end of July, which means seven months preparing the exam. I have to say that it was far away of being full time, because generally I used free time in the weekends and sometimes some hours during the week. There were months I was more focused and others that hardly I could find time. I had previous experience in web applications but it was not an excuse I needed to study and practice.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Materials:</span><br /><br /><ul><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Book HeadFirst Servlets &amp; JSP (O'Reilly). Authors: Bryan Basham, Kathy Sierra &amp; Bert Bates.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Servlets 3.0 specification (JSR-000315)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Whizlabs: OCEJWCD practice test. These test include: Diagnostic test, Practice test(I,II,III) and Final test.</span></li></ul><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">*Note:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Initially I was planning to use Enthuware (because is a good relation quality-price, and many people in javaRanch recommends it), but finally I have been using Whizlabs because I had access provided by my company, which is a good point.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Using whizlabs &nbsp;you connect to a web platform and you can take the tests (5 mock tests in total, test by section and reporting result). I have to say this platform also helped me a lot in practicing OCPJP7 exam.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>- Reading the book the first time</b>:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Reading a chapter carefully until completion, and after that trying to do the questions suggested in the book at the end (generally 6-10 mock questions). Evaluate the errors and read carefully the explanations.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This task was completed intermittently, in several weeks.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The approximately grade of advance was 1 topic per week.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I realized that when I was completing the last sections I hardly remember some details for the firsts chapters, so the most sensible was to start again, so...</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>- Reading the book the second time</b>:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I started to read the book again. This time I took notes in a notebook, something useful for a quick refresh. This time the reading was more fluent and help me to consolidate concepts.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This time&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I started to use Whizlabs mock exams by section at the same time I was advancing in studying.</span><br /><br /><b style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">- Further resources</b><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">new features included in Servlets 3.0 (annotations, asynchronous application, web fragments) are not included in the book.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>- Trying full mock tests from Whizlabs</b>:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Between June and the beginning of July I completed Dignostic Test, Test1, Test2, Test3.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>- Reading the book third time:</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This time was a reading marathon. I re-read the entire book in one weekend(15 days before the exam).</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>- The last week</b>:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I took again the demo test from Enthuware. &nbsp;(I took the same by February the first time), because I wanted to compare results and progression. The score was good.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I completed the last Mock Test from Enthuware (good result).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I focused in the question I failed, and I review the content.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I also reviewed my notes and summaries.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>- The big day:&nbsp;</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I had the exam at 10.30, it is recommend to arrive to the Pearson Vue test center with enough time in advance, so I arrived at 10.00. After waiting I was conducted to the exam area. You have to sign a paper and also provide a proof of identity (passport). Then you are taken a picture (not the best face before the exam :) ).&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The exam: I found a different range of questions in terms of difficulty. Some of them quite obvious an other very complex.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The good thing is that there is plenty of time to finish the exam (not like OCPJP7 that makes time a very important factor). I had enough time to review carefully full exam and also I had time left.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I found it difficult (but much less than OCPJP7).&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I could check the results after 30 minutes approximately. I received a mail from Oracle, and then I could connect to Oracle CertView page and see the results. I was very nervous because I was not entirely happy with my performance during the exam. Fortunately I passed, not a very impressive result but very happy for passing (it is a big relief).</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Lvm4S5ZkrM8/Vc754miSjbI/AAAAAAAAAZw/IZ5IXgHmXJA/s1600/OCE_JavaEE6WebCompDev_clr.bmp" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="136" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Lvm4S5ZkrM8/Vc754miSjbI/AAAAAAAAAZw/IZ5IXgHmXJA/s200/OCE_JavaEE6WebCompDev_clr.bmp" width="200" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>- Retrospective</b></span> <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I can see the improvement after studying.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I decided to start publishing little summaries, diagrams and little pieces of code about the topics in the exam. I hope the posts can be useful but they are far away to be a complete guide to pass the exam. I think is a good way to see if you know the objectives of the exam. For example the book head first is structured in a different way of the current exam for OCEJWCD6</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">But independently of a test score I feel I have progressed a lot in web knowledge. I have learnt a lot of new things I did not know, even with experience in web applications. That is why my experience with certifications is positive because helps you to make a studying target, and the result is always rewarding.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">In my opinion the actual value resides in the time spent reading, practicing and enjoying around areas specific in technology; not in the certification itself. Is a good way to be up to date and to refresh knowledge. I think also you can gain confidence as developer.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">My next certification in mind.....probably Oracle certified Expert, Java EE6 Enterprise JavaBeans Developer.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I wish you all the best if you decide to prepare this certification and I hope any of these posts can be useful for you.</span><br /><br /><i style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">OCEJWCD (SCWCD) - 1Z0-899 - Web Component Developer Certification</i>
